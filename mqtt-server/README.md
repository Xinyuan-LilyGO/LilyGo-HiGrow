Please run `activate_venv.bat` (on windows), or `activate_venv.sh` (on linux) before doing anything.

# Broker setup

A raspberry pi is set up as the server.  It is
 - running the MQTT broker (mosquitto)
 - running `server.py` as a service
 - running an mDNS service


## Running the server

Set up the python environment by running `source activate_venv.sh`

On raspberry pi you might need to run to make numpy work correctly (see https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html)
`sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev`

## Setting up the mDNS service

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
```
Open `/etc/hosts` and change the line `127.0.1.1` to the local domain name you want to use.  In this case we use `ttgo-server`.

Open `/etc/hostname` and change the line to `ttgo-server`

Then reboot
```
sudo reboot
```

The server will now be addressable via `ttgo-server.local`

## Setting up the server as a system service

- Ensure that you have a linux user `ttgo` (`sudo adduser ttgo`)
- Edit `systemd/ttgo-server.service` to point to where you have checked out the repo, and copy it to `/etc/systemd/system`
- Reload config with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
- Start the service with `sudo systemctl restart ttgo-server.service`

Check any output from the server using `sudo journalctl -u ttgo-server.service`
